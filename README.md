Expense Splitter (Week 1 Project)

This project is a small full stack web application where we can add, view and manage shared expenses between friends. When multiple people spend money in a group (trips, food, shopping etc…), it becomes confusing to find who owes how much amount. Expense Splitter helps to store all expenses in one place and later calculate balance between members. Our main purpose of this project is to practice team based development using Git & GitHub workflow with pull requests, reviews and branch protection rules.
